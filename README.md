I use SQL Fiddle (http://sqlfiddle.com) to practice and solve this problem. To see the result, on SQL Fiddle:
- choose MS SQL Server 2017
- copy the portion to create table from the sql script to the left window to create Schema
- copy the solution portion from the sql script to the right window. Note: need to select Keyword GO from the dropdown for Query Teminator under the right window before executing the script.

Website where I found this problem: https://techtfq.com/blog/real-sql-interview-question-asked-by-a-faang-company

You will find several solutions besides the website creator's solution and his video explaining his logic. The solution posted by random 'googler' was mine which is similar to the solution shown in the sql script.
